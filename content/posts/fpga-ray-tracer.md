This was my final project for 6.111 that I developed with Cece Chu. As the
second FPGA project that I spent a considerable amount of time on, I focused on
doing a lot of simulation and testing (as one should with FPGAs). Since our
approach to rendering was a little unusual and based on fixed point math, the
simulation was critical to validating the concept of the system.

All of the simulation was done using verilator to do unit testing, integration
testing, and produce simulated renders.
